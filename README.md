# About me :wave:
Geospatial data analyst with 5+ years of experience spanning the full life cycle 
of applied research, from project scoping and stakeholder communication to data 
wrangling and interactive visualization.

Bin Meister | Research Associate | Senior Data Analyst
built reports to drive operational improvements at a warehouse | researched post-COVID trends in economic activity | developed transportation performance metrics

In spring 2025, I completed my MS in Urban Informatics at Northeastern University,
where I spent a lot of time thinking about how we measure the performance of our
land use and transportation systems.

# What's in a measure? :straight_ruler:

Knowing our world empowers us to take action to shape it. When we don't know what 
to do, we often turn to measurement, hoping that the power of raw data can 
soothe our doubts and melt away any ambiguities about what to do. 

In truth, though, "raw data" is an oxymoron. All data are "cooked" to varying 
degrees through the process of measurement and then "consumed" through storytelling. 
Data analysts are thus pulled in multiple directions: we must tell compelling stories 
to convey the value of our measurements, but we must also manage expectations 
by accounting for the limitations of our measures in proxying the truths that
decision makers really care about. 

transition sentence into public transit - maybe something about how its benefits are diffuse and hard to measure
or maybe something more general about mobility vs accessibility paradigms

Make sure to make good use of visuals, and minimize the use of text, linking to more extensive reports, as needed.

will this measure section introduce concepts about measurements that I can use later on?
Is ridership a more "raw" while access is more "cooked"?

# Measuring Success for Public Transit :trolleybus:
why public transit matters (safety, equity, climate, health, and economic development)
what the stakes are for how we measure it

## Ridership
why ridership is so important to measure (benefits for both users and non-users)

why it should not be the only measure of public transit performance 

2. For each project:

a. The problem or question you addressed

b. The urban informatics methods you used to address them

c. The urban policy and/or management implications
