Bin Meister | Research Associate | Senior Data Analyst
built reports to improve warehouse operations | researched post-COVID demographic and economic trends | developed transportation performance metrics

In spring 2025, I completed my MS in Urban Informatics at Northeastern University,
where I explored how we measure the performance of our public transportation 
systems through several data analysis & research projects. 

# Measuring Success for Public Transit :trolleybus:
Public transit can deliver both direct benefits to riders (through affordable 
connections to jobs and services) and indirect benefits to non-riders (through 
congestion relief and emissions mitigation). To enssure that resources are
prioritized for the transit investments that will do the most good, careful 
con consideration of the measures we use to evaluate public transit performance
is required, since different measures can favor different investments. 

Two of the most important measures that are used to evaluate the overall
performance of public transit systems are:
-  **ridership** (how many trips people take)
-  **access** (how many destinations people can reach)

Ridership is a 
measure of actual behavior, while access is a measure of potential or opportunity.

*Most transit agencies don't seek to narrowly maximize ridership or access at an
aggregate level. In fact, a large portion of transit service is explicitly
designed not to maximize total ridership or access, but instead to provide some
sufficient level of service to a wide swath of communities, a dynamic which
Jarrett Walker calls the "<a href="https://humantransit.org/2018/02/basics-the-ridership-coverage-tradeoff.html">ridership-coverage tradeoff</a>".*

*However, in spite of the different value judgments that different agencies and
communities make about how to distribute service, measures of ridership and
access remain widely used across transit agencies, especially for evaluating
large-scale service changes.*

## Ridership
why ridership is so important to measure (benefits for both users and non-users)

Ridership is a near-ubiquitous measure of the success of public transit, both
because it's a barometer for the value people get from using transit and because
public transit usage has mostly positive externalities on the rest of society. 

However, both the user and social benefits of public transit tend to increase in 
proportion with the number of transit trips people take, making ridership one of 
the most ubiquitous measures of public transit performance.

Ridership measures what people are doing with transit (behavior), while access 
measures what people could do with transit (potential). Ridership is more established,
while destination access is relatively recent. Both are not fully within 
transit agencies' control / are functions of both land use and transportation. 
but ridership also fluctuates with changes in other modes (eg parking policy, gas prices)
whereas access is (mostly) only a function of land use and the mode-specific characteristics.
