# About me
Geospatial data analyst focused on measuring the performance of our land use and transportation systems. 

I have 5+ years of work experience spanning the full spectrum of data analytics, from project scoping and stakeholder communication to data engineering and interactive visualization. I currently serve as a Senior Data Analyst at the MassDOT/MBTA Office of Performance Management and Innovation, where I develop new and improved measures of statewide transportation performance to convey key insights to public, legislative, and internal audiences. Previously, I researched demographic and economic trends to help inform urban planning and policy at the City of Boston.

What's in a measure?

The measures we choose shape the stories we tell. All measures are imperfect proxies for the truths we care about - "raw data" is an oxymoron. All data are "cooked," it's our responsibility to cook in a way that clarifies and enhances the underlying ingredients (truths) rather than obscuring them.

or maybe something more general about mobility vs accessibility paradigms

Make sure to make good use of visuals, and minimize the use of text, linking to more extensive reports, as needed.



# Measuring Success for Public Transit
why public transit matters (safety, equity, climate, health, and economic development)
what the stakes are for how we measure it

## Ridership
why ridership is so important to measure (benefits for both users and non-users)

why it should not be the only measure of public transit performance 

2. For each project:

a. The problem or question you addressed

b. The urban informatics methods you used to address them

c. The urban policy and/or management implications
