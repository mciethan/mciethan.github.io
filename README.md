In spring 2025, I completed my MS in Urban Informatics at Northeastern University,
where I explored how we measure the performance of our public transportation 
systems. Read on to learn more about some of the data analysis & research 
projects I completed. 

# Measuring Success for Public Transit :trolleybus:
Public transit can deliver both direct benefits to riders (through affordable 
connections to jobs and services) and indirect benefits to non-riders (through 
congestion relief and reduced emissions per capita). 

How can we ensure that society's resources are prioritized for the transit investments 
that will do the most good? An important step is to carefully consider which metrics 
we use to evaluate public transit performance, since different metrics can favor 
different investments. 

Two of the most important kinds of metrics that are used to evaluate the overall
performance of public transit systems are:
-  **ridership** (how many trips people take)
-  **access** (how many places people can reach)

Ridership measures actual behavior, while access measures potential or opportunity.

<summary><i>Tangent: are ridership and access the only goals that transit agencies have?</summary>

<br>Most transit agencies don't seek to narrowly maximize ridership or access at an
aggregate level. In fact, a large portion of transit service is explicitly
designed not to maximize total ridership or access, but instead to provide a
basic level of service to a wide swath of communities, a dynamic which Jarrett
Walker calls the "<a href="https://humantransit.org/2018/02/basics-the-ridership-coverage-tradeoff.html">ridership-coverage tradeoff</a>".
Different agencies apply different value judgments about how to distribute 
service.

Although ridership and access are not the only goals that transit agencies have,
both metrics remain in widespread use, especially for evaluating large-scale 
service changes.</i>

## Ridership
One reason why ridership is such an important and ubiquitous measure of public 
transit performance is that both the direct and indirect benefits of transit 
tend to increase in proportion with the number of transit trips people take.

I analyzed some of the factors that predict MBTA subway ridership and found that:
* higher ridership comes not just from more frequent and faster trains, but also from mixed land uses and walkability in the areas surrounding stations
* many of the factors that predict high ridership are highly correlated with each other, making conventional modeling techniques difficult

## Access

 ridership also fluctuates with changes in other modes (eg parking policy, gas prices)
whereas access is (mostly) only a function of land use and the mode-specific characteristics.
