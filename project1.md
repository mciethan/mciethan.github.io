## Summary

Many public transit systems were designed to serve downtown commutes as a primary market, but the rise of remote and hybrid work coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic has scrambled ridership demand patterns. 

This study helps answer the following questions:

* Should transit ridership modelers pivot away from their traditional focus on job density and pay greater attention to colleges, hospitals, shopping centers, and other points of interest that are likely to generate non-work trips?
* What other service characteristics, demographic patterns, and built environment factors have changed since 2019 in terms of how much they affect transit ridership?

Ultimately, we found no evidence that transit ridership models would become significantly more accurate by incorporating the locations of non-work trip generators. However, our models suggest that improving walkability and encouraging mixed land uses around transit stations can yield strong and complementary increases in post-pandemic ridership potential. Our findings also confirm more general policy lessons from previous literature about the importance of service frequency and connectivity for attracting riders to public transit.
