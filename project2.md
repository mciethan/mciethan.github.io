## Summary

intro paragraph

This study helps answer the following questions:
* 

I found that changes in job access due to changes in frequency have a highly unequal distribution both spatially and demographically, in ways that might not be apparent when only considering those changes in terms of train frequencies. Additionally, by comparing the net access losses from these frequency cuts with the net access gains resulting from the MBTAâ€™s Green Line Extension, I demonstrate that improving operational frequencies on existing transit infrastructure can yield access benefits which exceed those provided by major expansions of infrastructure.
